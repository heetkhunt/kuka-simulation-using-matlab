### **MATLAB Simulation: KUKA iiwa 7 Robot Handling an Object with Collision Detection**

This simulation is all about bringing a **KUKA iiwa 7 robotic arm** to life, attaching a **THWS gripper**, and making it interact with objects in its environment. The main goal? Move the arm while keeping a safe distance from obstacles—just like a real-world robotic system would!

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**
1. **Setting Up the Robot and Gripper**
   - The simulation starts by loading the **KUKA iiwa 7 model** and adding a custom gripper. 
   - The gripper is attached to the **end-effector**, allowing it to interact with objects.
   - The system is displayed using an interactive visualization, so we can see how the robot moves.

2. **Creating the Workspace**
   - A **worktop** (grey in color) is added as a solid surface.
   - A **red cuboid** is introduced as an obstacle—something the gripper needs to avoid.
   - These objects are included in the scene for collision checking later.

3. **Configuring the Robot’s Motion**
   - Several predefined **joint configurations** are set to guide the robot through different positions.
   - These configurations simulate **how the arm moves over time**, making it more dynamic.

4. **Using Inverse Kinematics (IK)**
   - The **TCP (Tool Center Point)** is positioned in space.
   - The inverse kinematics solver determines **the exact joint angles needed** to reach that position.
   - The robot is then updated with these new joint values.

5. **Generating Smooth Movement**
   - Instead of jumping between configurations, a **smooth trajectory** is computed using a velocity-based method.
   - A **rate controller** makes sure the animation runs at a steady pace.
   - The arm transitions through multiple poses in an **organic, fluid** manner.

6. **Collision Detection & Distance Measurement**
   - The simulation checks for potential **collisions between the gripper and the obstacle**.
   - The **minimum separation distance** is tracked and plotted over time, showing how close the gripper gets.
   - If the collision model isn’t set up correctly (like the TCP not being included), it might return incorrect values.

### **What This Means**
This experiment gives us a **practical look** at robotic motion planning, object manipulation, and safety precautions when working around obstacles. It’s useful for **optimizing robotic movements**, **ensuring collision-free paths**, and **studying how robots interact in real-world environments**.
